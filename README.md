# Reading Questions

## Week 1 - Two body problem

- what are the constants of motion for two-bodies in orbit around each other?
- what is meant by the term "mean motion"?
- sketch an elliptical orbit and label it
- what is the difference between mean anomaly, true anomaly, and eccentric anomaly?
- what is Kepler's equation?
- if you want to set up an orbit with semi-major axis a and eccentrity e, how do you choose the initial location and velocity?
- explain why, even though the Moon is tidally-locked, it appears to wobble (librate) to an observer on Earth
- underneath each of eqs (2.157) and (2.162), the text gives a brief physical explanation. Explain how the physical explanation gives rise to the equation in each case.
